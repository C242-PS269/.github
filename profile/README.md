#### Theme
Digital Experiences: Revolutionizing Sustainable Tourism

#### Research Questions
1. What impact does a centralized, AI-powered travel app have on the overall experience and satisfaction of tourists exploring unfamiliar destinations?
2. To what extent does a travel app simplify destination discovery and reduce planning challenges for tourists compared to traditional methods of information gathering?
3. How do AI-driven recommendation systems in travel apps influence tourists' ability to uncover unique experiences and hidden gems that align with their interests?

#### Project Overview
<p align=justify>
By leveraging AI-powered recommendation engines, EzTrip offers personalized suggestions based on users' interests and travel goals, streamlining the process of destination discovery, booking, and expense management. With an integrated expense tracker and generated itineraries, users can monitor their travel budgets in real-time, making it easier to plan and control spending throughout their journey. Our team is focused on enhancing Indonesia’s tourism experience by making local insights accessible to global tourists and supporting sustainable tourism growth. This project seeks to solve real challenges in destination planning for foreign travelers by simplifying their access to curated travel information & budgeting.

#### Notes

<p align=justify>
Our team envisioned EzTrip as a tool covering destinations across Indonesia, but due to limited time and resources, we tried to focus only on Bali first. Bali’s popularity offers an ideal setting to implement our data-driven features like recommendations, sentiment analysis, and image recognition. This approach enables us to create a quality user experience while setting the foundation to expand to other areas in the future. We also apologize if some app components differ from initial plans; any adjustments were necessary and remain aligned with our theme of sustainable tourism, ensuring an engaging travel experience.
